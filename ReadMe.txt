___What are the controls to your game? How do we play?___
Mouse - Click on cards to interact.
A target card will be displayed in the middle of the screen. Search face-up cards in your hand (the bottom rows of cards) for cards that are of identical rank, or adjacent (+1 or -1) to play on top of the target card. More of your hand will be revealed as you use cards in upper rows. If nothing can be played, draw a new target card from the draw pile in the top right of the screen. If you manage to clear all cards in your hand, you win. If you cannot before the draw pile is exhausted, you lose.

I and a few other classmates seem to have had it that when the face sprites were set up in the CardSprites ScriptableObject, something went wrong. Might want to be addressed in the book @Jeremy. :)
